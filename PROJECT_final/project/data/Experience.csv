While there, I worked directly with the CEO, CFO and senior management team on several initiatives including: weighing the pros/cons of pursuing a radically different customer strategy, creating a plan to help the company grow in a very attractive market, in which it had a limited presence and, more tactically, creating financial standards and KPIs to monitor and evaluate the performance of the business.",NA,NA,"2015-03-05 18:45:30 UTC","2015-03-05 18:45:30 UTC"

Hire 1-2-3 - was designed to use a combination of the products and services offered by the HRD Press family of companies. Hire1-2-3 used the assessments, applicant-processing software, interview tools, guides and more to develop a streamlined hiring and selection process for your organization. Clients received a customized Individual Hiring Plan (IHP) for your position (written by Ethan Bloomfield). Hire 1-2-3 then used the IHP to execute any or all aspects of the hiring process.

We make it fast, easy and affordable for organizations to find pre-screened and vetted scholars and industry professionals.

Our Vision: To develop the world’s best database of vetted scholars and industry professionals available to teach, train, speak, and provide subject matter expertise.

Here is what we know, and the problem we are solving:
Deans, Program Chairs, Program Directors, and other hiring managers at many colleges and universities have a hard time attracting qualified professionals who want to teach part-time in their programs. These academic administrators have a hundred other things to do and do not have the time to conduct a full job search for qualified candidates for every course needing an instructor.

At the same time, there are successful professionals out there who are interested in teaching part-time at the college level. They don’t know exactly how to get their foot in the door or the cumbersome application process becomes too much of a hassle. They simply want to teach a course or two a semester to add to their resume, give back and share their practical knowledge with eager minds, and be in conversation with thought leaders in their field.

To solve this problem, we created a one-stop resource that can bring the two together. It is fast, easy, efficient and most of all, effective.",NA,NA,"2015-04-15 14:23:36 UTC","2015-04-15 14:23:36 UTC"

Kamasajei is actively facilitating a wider body of complete research on the role of bodywork and integrative therapies in neurohormonal regulation and brainwave states with the goal of citizen scientists with Quantified Self tools, preventive care techniques, and integrative strategies to reach personal “flourish states"".

About Our Interactive Exhibition:
Visitors become participants as they are fitted with neural headsets, engage in the exhibit directly, viewing Brain Maps of their personal alpha, beta, delta and theta activity in real time as they receive Neuromuscular Facilitation, learning the meaning and real-life applications of the dynamic changes they are viewing. They discover how athletes, corporate teams and artists are learning to guide their physical performance, focus states and emotional states by taking an integrative approach to their micro and macro physical connections.

We say this because at Gold Core International, we truly believe in a world in which the ability to inspire those around you to achieve greatness, should be practiced and taught by the majority, in order to create organisation that help shape the future of tomorrow.

We believe in the positive power of inspiration and encouragement because we understand that people who love going to work are more productive and more creative. They go home happier and have happier families and they treat their colleagues, clients and customers with a more pleasant and productive attitude. 

At Gold Core International we imagine a world full of unyielding companies that ultimately give rise to stronger economies.

Managed the process of responding to Requests For Proposals using Microsoft Word. I created a repository of template responses for commonly asked questions and FAQ documents. Interfaced with sales and potential customers to write the RFP. Met all deadlines. Managed review cycle. Edit Implementation schedule using Microsoft Project.
Researched and wrote online help in Windows and HTML format using ForeHelp and ForeHTML. This required manually fixing tags in the HTML. Forehelp used a problematic tag that had to be stripped out using search and replace software, and then recompiled using Microsoft HTML Help Workshop. ForeHelp is a competitor of RoboHelp. 
Illustrated the help topics and user guides using vector graphic tools and bitmap graphic tools, such as Visio and Paintshop Pro. Used FullShot  for screenshots. 
Demonstrated problem solving by creating a method of single-source conversion from 3000 help topics to a 1400 page user guide. To do this, I exported help topics from Forehelp into Word. I used templates to convert the styles used in Forehelp. I created macros that fixed the format. I generated a table of contents and index. I used Adobe Distiller to generate PDF files for the user guide. 
Designed the help system so that it was possible to do single-source conversion to a generate System Overview and Reports Sample Guides. 
Interviewed subject matter experts and solicited cooperation from team members that included software developers, customer care, network administrators, sales, finance, management, and legal departments.

The goal was to test the format in current markets where we believed a single store with all categories made more sense than three separate stores.  Also to test in selected smaller markets where the expense structure of three separate stores was not cost effective.  Within the first year we had tested and selected a name, developed store formats, floor plans and a host of new services to test. Our next step was to formulate a marketing plan to open four concept stores in smaller markets. Within 12 months we had the first four stores opened in smaller markets and the favorable results allowed us to move forward with the second phase in current markets. In year two of the project we selected nine stores in one market, developed a renovation and marketing plan to open these stores in 8 months.  The results of the test proved the combination in current markets increased store visits by 10% and the average sale by approximately 12%.",NA,NA,"2014-11-02 19:36:47 UTC","2014-11-02 19:36:47 UTC"

Challenged with rising production costs and the need to reduce creative process timelines I recognized the need to revamp the aged and outdated advertising production process.

I assembled a task force, we developed a proposal format, identified potential companies, set up interviews and reviewed each of the organization’s capabilities.

The UMA accounts will include stocks, bonds, mutual funds and ETF’s, all within a single account.

Specific duties entailed, developing, testing, and implementation of enhancements for the CST (Customer Statements) project, which will enhance the AAG (At-A-Glance) customer statements, by giving the customer more options and control of the content presented on their statements.

Specific duties entailed, developing, testing, and implementation of enhancements for the CAI (Customer Account’s Information) / NotePad project, which will replace the existing “Green Screens” / Mainframe application with a GUI application that Adds more functionally and convenience for the users.
